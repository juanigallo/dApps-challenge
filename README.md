# DApps Challenge

The idea of this challenge is to create a dApp that has the ability to interact with [Compound’s cDAI contract in Kovan’s testnet](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0xF0d0EB522cfa50B716B3b1604C4F0fA6f04376AD). 

## The dApp should be able to:

- Connect to metamask
- Get the cDAI balance and show it in the UI
- Deposit DAI to the contract directly from the UI
- Get the transaction history of the connected wallet

## Additional information:

- cDAI and DAI are not 1:1, we should display the amount in cDAI
- If connected to Kovan network, you can Deposit, Borrow, Repay and Redeem directly from: [https://app.compound.finance/](https://app.compound.finance/)
- You can use this [Faucet](https://faucet.paradigm.xyz/) to get tokens
- If you are going to use a subgraph, [this one](https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/juanigallo/cdai-kovan-subgraph) or create your own one
